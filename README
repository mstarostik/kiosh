kiosh - Kiosk Shell

Nothing fancy, really.  On a Windows system you can easily configure something
else than explorer.exe as a shell which comes in handy for kiosk applications
and the likes.  One problem of this approach is that it not only removes the
desktop and task bar, but also skips some session initialization that is
normally performed by explorer.exe.  The most important of such initializations
to me is to run Active Setup per-user installation stubs.  When deploying
software to such systems, some things need to be run once for each new and
existing user account.  Active Setup can handly this quite nicely, but its stubs
are only run if the defaul shell - explorer.exe - is used.  Enter kiosh.  It
basically just calls out to an undocumented(?) API to let Active Setup do its
job and then launches the actual (kiosk) application.

Have fun!
